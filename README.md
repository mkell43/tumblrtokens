tumblrtokens
============

Small package for creating Tumblr Oauth tokens.

Unnecessarily abstracts them out from your application.  But it seemed silly to rewrite each time I wanted to
authenticate against Tumblr.

Installation
------------

You can install this through pip, by doing running following.

`pip install git+https://github.com/mkell43/tumblrtokens.git`

Though, when reinstalling from a requirements file, you'll need to remember
that it will likely fail at this step and you will need to re-run this
command manually.
